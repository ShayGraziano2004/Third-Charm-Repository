Overview
In our game, you play as a courageous dwarf miner who ventures into the depths of a newly revealed cave system. 
An earthquake has just shaken an old, believed-to-be-tapped-out mine, uncovering paths into previously unexplored natural caverns. 
These caverns hold precious ores, but they're also home to dangerous subterranean creatures and treacherous traps.

Gameplay
As the dwarf miner, you will navigate through the dark and perilous caverns, using your trusty pickaxe not only to mine valuable ores
but also as your primary weapon against the creatures that lurk in the shadows. Be prepared to face various enemies, from agile cave spiders 
to lumbering stone golems.

As of right now there is not a downloadable file for this game, but it is being developed!
